keepod-vmimages
===============

This project holds document and scripts for creating VM images of Keepod, not those image files. VM image files are too large to be kept on github.

At first, we just need document the steps of manually install Android. Then, we need to write scripts to automatically install Android and publish the result image on the web. It's better to have some scripts for testing the image.
